#React-FizzBuzz
##A classic fizzbuzz implementation
I made a simple Fizzbuzz implentation to learn React.js. As with all React apps, the source in ```src/``` must be compiled from JSX to JavaScript to work properly. Use this command to compile to JS in the ```build/``` directory when files change:

```bash
jsx --watch src/ build/
```
FYI: you may need to ```npm install -g react-tools``` if you haven't already.
